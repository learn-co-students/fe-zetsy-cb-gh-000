                    Jewelry in the Americas has an ancient history. Beginning as
                    far back as 8800 BCE, Paleo-Indians in the American Southwest drilled and shaped
                    multicolored stones and shells into beads and pendants. Olivella shell beads,
                    dating from 6000 BCE, were found in Nevada; bone, antler, and possibly marine
                    shell beads from 7000 BCE were found in Russell Cave in Alabama; copper jewelry
                    was traded from Lake Superior beginning in 3000 BCE; and stone beads were carved
                    in Poverty Point in Louisiana in 1500 BCE. Learn more.
