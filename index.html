      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Jewelry in the Americas has an ancient history. Beginning as far back as 8800 BCE,
        Paleo-Indians in the American Southwest drilled and shaped multicolored stones and
        shells into beads and pendants. Olivella shell beads, dating from 6000 BCE, were
        found in Nevada; bone, antler, and possibly marine shell beads from 7000 BCE were
        found in Russell Cave in Alabama; copper jewelry was traded from Lake Superior
        beginning in 3000 BCE; and stone beads were carved in Poverty Point in Louisiana
        in 1500 BCE.
